SCimilarity
================================================================================

**SCimilarity** is a unifying representation of single cell expression profiles
that quantifies similarity between expression states and generalizes to
represent new studies without additional training.

This enables a novel cell search capability, which sifts through millions of
profiles to find cells similar to a query cell state and allows researchers to
quickly and systematically leverage massive public scRNA-seq atlases to learn
about a cell state of interest.
